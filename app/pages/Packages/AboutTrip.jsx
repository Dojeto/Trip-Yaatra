            Experience the majestic beauty of Ladakh with this 10-day Leh Ladakh
            tour package that takes you on a journey through some of the most
            breathtaking landscapes in the world. Starting from Srinagar, the
            capital of Jammu and Kashmir, the tour takes you to Kargil, Leh,
            Nubra, Pangong, Sarchu, and Manali before concluding in Delhi. The
            trip begins with a local sightseeing tour of Srinagar, followed by a
            visit to Kargil, famous for its role in the India-Pakistan war. From
            there, the journey proceeds towards Leh, the capital city of Ladakh,
            where you will explore popular attractions like Pathar Sahib
            Gurudwara, Magnetic Hill, and Sangam. The tour then takes you to
            Nubra Valley, a picturesque region known for its sand dunes and lush
            greenery. You will also visit Turtuk, a remote village located close
            to the Pakistan border that has recently been opened to tourists.
            From there, the journey continues to Pangong Tso, a serene
            high-altitude lake that changes color throughout the day, before
            heading back to Leh. The final leg of the tour takes you through
            Sarchu and Manali, two popular tourist destinations in Himachal
            Pradesh, before concluding in Delhi. With comfortable
            accommodations, well-planned itinerary, and expert guidance
            throughout the journey, this Leh Ladakh tour package promises an
            unforgettable experience for travelers seeking adventure and natural
            beauty.
